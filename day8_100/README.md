# 100 Days of coding - Day 8: Little affirmation generatorðŸ¥°

## Description

Today's focus is using all the skills I've learned so far such as:

- input and output
- concatenation
- if statements
- nested if statements

In addition, I've learned the `lower()` method from python to make any string to lower case
With all of that, I built a custom affirmations generator to give the user a customized affirmation each day of the week
